# Nuclear Weapon Tests

The goal of this project is to present nuclear weapon test locations on a map together with basic information of the test. 

But first, an extensive data cleaning is needed for the dataset, as the dataset is an excellent example of a messy data. The dataset is obtained from  https://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Library/Catalog, and includes nuclear tests from 1945 to 1996. 

Notebook [NuclearWeaponTests_Cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/MariaanaT/NuclearWeaponTests/blob/main/NuclearWeaponTests_Cleaning.ipynb) concentraces on the data cleaning process. The plots are generated in [NuclearWeaponTests_Visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/MariaanaT/NuclearWeaponTests/blob/main/NuclearWeaponTests_Visualization.ipynb). 

R markdown files NuclearWeaponTests_Cleaning.Rmd and NuclearWeaponTests_Visualization.Rmd are also presented, but most probably won't be updated in the future.
