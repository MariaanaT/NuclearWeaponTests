# NuclearWeaponTests

The goal of this project is to present nuclear weapon test locations on a map. 

But first, an extensive data cleaning is needed for the dataset, as the dataset is an excellent example of a messy data. The dataset is obtained from  https://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Library/Catalog, and includes nuclear tests from 1945 to 1996. 

Document NuclearWeaponTests_Cleaning.Rmd is concentrating on the data cleaning process. The plots are generated in NuclearWeaponTests_Visualization.Rmd.
